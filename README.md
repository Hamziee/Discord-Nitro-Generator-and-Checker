## About The Project

It generates and checks discord nitro codes at the same time for maximum efficiency

### Built With

* [Requests](https://github.com/psf/requests)
* [Discord webhook](https://github.com/lovvskillz/python-discord-webhook)
* [Colored](https://gitlab.com/dslackw/colored)


### Prerequisites
You need to install Python, that can be done [here](https://www.python.org)

### Installation
1. Get the files (2 Ways)
  Click on Code, then download zip. Or:
  
  Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/logicguy1/Discord-Nitro-Generator-and-Checker.git
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   # Windows:
   py -3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Unix
   python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
   
#### Or this can be done using android with unrooted Termux
```
pkg install git
git clone https://github.com/Hamziee/Discord-Nitro-Generator-and-Checker
pkg install python
cd Discord-Nitro-Generator-and-Checker
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
   
## Usage

Run the `main.py` file using `py -3 main.py` 
The code will show you two prompts:
1. How many codes to generate 
2. If you want to use a discord webhook, if you dont know how to get a discord webhook url it is located at   
   ```channel settings » intergrations » webhooks » create webhook```  
   If you dont want to use a webhook simply leave this blank  

The code will start generating and checking after that step
